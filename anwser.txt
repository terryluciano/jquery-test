1. In your own words, describe at least three common uses of JavaScript in web pages:

- Interactivity: JavaScript adds interactivity by responding to user actions like clicks, submissions, and mouse movements, updating content dynamically without refreshing the page for a better user experience.

- DOM Manipulation: JavaScript offers powerful APIs for modifying the DOM, letting developers dynamically change HTML elements' structure, content, and style, enabling dynamic updates and animations.

- Client-side Validation: JavaScript enables client-side form validation to ensure user input meets criteria before server submission, improving UX with instant feedback and fewer server round-trips.

2. Explain the purpose of the Document Object Model (DOM) in web development:

- The Document Object Model (DOM) in web development serves as a structured, tree-like representation of a web page, allowing languages like JavaScript to interact and manipulate the page. It enables dynamic content changes, event handling, and overall interactivity without page reloading.

3. List and briefly describe three common events that can be handled using JavaScript in the DOM:

- Click Events: Triggered when a user clicks on an element. This is often used to initiate actions like form submission or navigation.

- Mouseover Events: Triggered when a user moves the mouse over an element. This can be used to display additional information or highlight the element.

- Keydown Events: Triggered when a user presses a key on the keyboard. This can be used for actions like form validation or game controls.

4. Describe at least three common uses of jQuery in web development.

- jQuery simplifies DOM manipulation with a consistent API for dynamically changing web page content, structure, and style. It also streamlines event handling by offering an easy syntax and handling cross-browser inconsistencies automatically, and provides a powerful API for Ajax requests, making data fetching from servers seamless without page reloads.

5. Explain how to obtain jQuery, whether through downloading the library or using aContent Delivery Network (CDN)

- You can download jQuery from their website and include it in your project files. This method allows you to host the jQuery library on your own server.

- You can include a link to jQuery hosted on a CDN like Google (I used Google) or Microsoft in your HTML. This method can offer improved performance and availability.
